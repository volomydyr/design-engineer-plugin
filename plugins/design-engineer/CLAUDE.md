# Design Engineer Plugin Development

## Versioning Requirements

Every change to this plugin MUST include updates to all three files:

1. **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** - Bump version using semver
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Document changes using Keep a Changelog format
3. **`README.md`** - Verify/update component counts

### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major reorganization
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New skills, agents, or commands
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, doc updates, minor improvements

## Skill Compliance Checklist

When adding or modifying skills:

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)

- [ ] `name:` present and matches directory name
- [ ] `description:` present, describes what it does AND when to use it
- [ ] `disable-model-invocation: true` present on ALL skills

### Content Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- [ ] ALL content from source files only – never generic internet knowledge
- [ ] English only – no Ukrainian names or translated names
- [ ] Each skill covers exactly ONE activity
- [ ] Prescribes exact workflows from the author's experience
- [ ] Guides thinking process, not just outputs deliverables
- [ ] Enforces User > Docs > AI decision hierarchy
- [ ] Reference files contain FULL ADAPTED content, not summaries
- [ ] Sources merged silently – no attribution like "from the book"

### Structural Rules

- [ ] SKILL.md under 500 lines – detailed content in references/
- [ ] All reference files linked with proper markdown: `[file.md](./references/file.md)`
- [ ] No placeholder text (TODO, TBD, [fill in])
- [ ] AskUserQuestion with numbered-list fallback for cross-platform compatibility

### Pre-Commit Checklist

- [ ] Version bumped in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] README.md component counts verified
- [ ] All JSON files valid (`python3 -m json.tool`)

## Command Naming Convention

Commands use `de:` prefix (short for design-engineer) to avoid conflicts with Claude Code's built-in `/review` and `/plan`:

- `/de:setup` - One-time plugin configuration
- `/de:design` - Full design workflow orchestrator
- `/de:research` - UX research activities
- `/de:psych` - Psychology audit and deep-dives
- `/de:dev` - Development pipeline
- `/de:review` - Multi-layer design review
- `/de:compound` - Knowledge documentation

## Living Documents

Deliverables created by this plugin are living documents tracked via `.dependencies.yaml`. When an upstream deliverable changes, downstream documents may need review. The hook scripts in `hooks/` implement this tracking automatically.
