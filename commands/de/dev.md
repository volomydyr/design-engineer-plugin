# Development Pipeline

## Context

<context> #$ARGUMENTS </context>

Sets up and runs the development workflow. Use after the design pipeline or standalone.

## Step 1: Read project context

1. Read `.design-engineer-plugin/config.yaml` for mode (guided/autopilot), project type, and environment
2. Scan the project: what tech stack, what build tools, does CLAUDE.md exist, are agents configured?
3. If `.design-engineer-plugin/config.yaml` not found, tell the user to run `/de:start` first

## Step 1.5: Detect build targets

Read the MVP requirements and Information Architecture documents (if they exist). Before suggesting any tech stack, the product type, platform, and technical requirements should be obvious from these documents. Do not suggest technologies that contradict the product design (e.g., do not suggest Electron for a native macOS overlay app).

Identify distinct build targets – for example:
- macOS app + web landing page = 2 targets
- Chrome extension + backend API = 2 targets
- Web app only = 1 target

If multiple build targets exist, ask via AskUserQuestion:

```
question: "Your product has multiple build targets. Which would you like to build first?"
header: "Build targets"
options:
  - label: "[Target 1]"
    description: "[Tech stack and scope]"
  - label: "[Target 2]"
    description: "[Tech stack and scope]"
allowMultiSelect: false
```

```
multiSelect: false  # User must choose one target to start with
```

Each build target gets its own development setup: tech stack, repo/folder, CLAUDE.md, design system, development loop. After the first target is complete, ask if the user wants to proceed to the next target.

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT**: If multiple targets detected, wait for the user's choice before proceeding.

## Step 2: Plan

Based on what you found, present a plan. Only suggest what's relevant:

- **CLAUDE.md setup** – needed if no CLAUDE.md exists or it's outdated
- **Agent pipeline** – needed if no agents are configured
- **MCP configuration** – only if MCPs are missing or misconfigured
- **GitHub workflow** – only if git is initialized and no workflow is set up
- **Context management** – needed for long-running projects
- **Kick-start prompts** – helpful for teams, optional for solo
- **Feature implementation** – if the user's goal was "Implement from Figma" or they have a specific feature to build

If an argument was provided (`/de:dev setup`, `/de:dev pipeline`), skip planning and go directly to that activity.

In **Guided mode**: ask the user to confirm or adjust the plan.
In **Autopilot**: show the plan briefly, then execute.

## Step 3: Execute

### Setup activities

| Activity | Skill |
|----------|-------|
| CLAUDE.md setup | `dev-claude-md` |
| Agent pipeline | `dev-agent-setup` |
| MCP configuration | `dev-mcp-setup` |
| GitHub workflow | `dev-github-workflow` |
| Context management | `dev-status-tracking` |
| Kick-start prompts | `dev-starter-prompts` |

In **Guided mode**: run one at a time, present results, ask for feedback.
In **Autopilot**: run all planned activities, present summary.

### Feature implementation

Before writing ANY code, follow these steps in order:

**1. Read existing patterns**: Scan the project's component architecture (atoms/, molecules/, organisms/, pages/). Understand design tokens, naming conventions, file structure. Read relevant skill reference files for design knowledge.

**2. Read the plan template**: Read `skills/meta-setup/references/plan-template.md` — this is the exact format your plan must follow.

**3. Enter Plan Mode**: Use `EnterPlanMode` to write the implementation plan. Do NOT present the plan as chat text, a summary table, or TaskCreate items. The plan MUST follow the template format with all required fields: Summary, Phases (each with Objective, Depends on, Files, Reuse, Checklist, QA), Risk assessment, Questions for user.

**4. Get approval**: Use `ExitPlanMode` for user approval.

**5. Copy the plan**: IMMEDIATELY after approval, copy the plan to `plans/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[descriptive-name].md` in the project root. Create the `plans/` directory if it doesn't exist. **This step is CRITICAL — without it, TDD hooks and fidelity hooks cannot activate. Do not write any code until the plan is in `plans/`.**

**6. Create feature branch**: If on main/master, run `git checkout -b feat/[plan-slug]`.

**7. TDD**: Before writing production code, use `test-writer` to create failing tests. Run tests to verify Red phase (fails because feature is missing). This is not optional.

**8. Implement phase by phase**: Follow the plan's phases in order. For each phase:
   a. Implement only this phase's changes
   b. Run `/simplify` on changed code (mandatory after every Write/Edit)
   c. Completeness review: check the plan's checklist for this phase
   d. Present to user with QA instructions from the plan
   e. Wait for approval before next phase
   f. After approval, commit using `dev-github-workflow`

**9. After all phases**: Run `design-system-auditor` to audit compliance. Run `meta-document` to record progress.

### Visual verification (UI changes only)

After implementing changes to UI components or pages:
1. Start the dev server if not running (`npm run dev` or equivalent)
2. Use Playwright to navigate to the affected page on localhost
3. Take a screenshot
4. Analyze: does the result match expectations? Check layout, spacing, color, animation direction, element visibility
5. If issues found: fix them before presenting to the user
6. If clean: proceed to present the phase for review

Skip this step for data-only, type-only, or configuration changes.

### Mode differences

In **Guided mode**: the main model implements step by step. Agents can run for analysis but present their output step by step. Pause after each phase for user review.
In **Autopilot**: delegate to agents for speed. Run the full cycle, present results at the end.

## Post-execution

ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion with specific options. Never end with a plain text question.

For existing projects:
```
question: "What would you like to do next?"
header: "Next step"
options:
  - label: "Next feature"
    description: "Pick up the next feature from the build sequence"
  - label: "Review implementation"
    description: "Review the implementation for quality, accessibility, or design compliance"
  - label: "Document what we changed"
    description: "Record what was built and why"
  - label: "Done for now"
    description: "End the session"
```

For new products (project_type: new), auto-invoke meta-document after implementation cycles before presenting options.
